## Blogging almost every day in 2021! 🎉

Hi everyone! 👋

Today I am starting to blog almost every day(weekdays) until next year! 🎉

I was inspired by [Pat Walls](https://twitter.com/thepatwalls) who [published 142 blog posts in 12 months](https://patwalls.com/how-i-published-142-blog-posts-in-12-months).

A blog post can be as short as 5 words and it doesn't have to be specific technical, it can be about finances, business, entrepreneurship, design anything actually. I want to use this blog platform as a way to put my thoughts after a long day (kinda like journaling...).

Also, because some days will be hard to post than others (motivation, stress, workload), I am gonna try and do my best :)

I always liked writing, but I stopped myself from blogging many times because I felt that I have to have a very good story in the first place. As without a good story, there is no need to write anything as no one will read it anyway.

Now, I realize that this mindset is not the best and it stopped me many times from actually doing great stuff. You can call it procrastination... 🥱

Also, this will probably improve my writing skills a lot, which I definitely need... 😅

That was it for today folks! Make sure to check in tomorrow where I am gonna share with you my design/coding process of developing my portfolio in Next.js. It's gonna be fun! 🕺

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊

*Remember, you are worthy, you are loved and you matter! Have a great day! ❤️*
