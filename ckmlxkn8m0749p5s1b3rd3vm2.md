## Another CodeMentor session that went great! 🔥

I have been  [accepted to CodeMentor](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/just-got-accepted-on-codementor)  recently and since then I got 2 sessions that went amazingly well!

I found that I really enjoy helping people with their problems and also I discovered that I have more knowledge to share than I thought I do...

The first time I joined the platform, I had my rate as $10/15 min. I found out that this doesn't really work for me as I can do other stuff from which I can make more money, but at the same time I enjoy mentoring, so I have raised my rate to $20/15 min which would allow me to sustain myself and at the same time provide value to my mentees.

If you are stuck on a problem or need some advice on something, feel free to ping me on codementor.io, I will be happy to help you! **The first 15 min is free of charge!** (for the first session on CodeMentor) 😊

That's it for today folks! See you tomorrow! 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊

*Remember, you are worthy, you are loved and you matter! Have a great day! ❤️*
