## Preparing to leave Bali ✈️

Today I am gonna keep this post more like a personal log, than a usual article as I wrote quite a long post yesterday. I need a break 😁

# Flying home

After spending 2 years on this beautiful island, we are finally ready to come home. (mom)

At the moment, I and my spouse are waiting to [get vaccinated in Bali](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/getting-a-covid-19-vaccine-in-bali). After that, we are planning to get married 👰🤵 in her hometown and then fly to Moldova to see my family 😊

We are sad to leave Bali 😔, but at the same time we really miss our families and it's time to pay them a visit.

We are planning to come back tho after seeing Europe for a bit. Who knows, maybe we will even move there permanently. 😳

If you ever thought to visit Bail, I highly recommend it! It's a magical place that teaches you a lot of lessons about life! 🌈

That was it for today, hope to see you tomorrow 😊
