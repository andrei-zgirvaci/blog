## My experience with Chalestenics so far... 💪

# Life

As you guys know, I am trying a new workout routine which I wrote an article about [workout routine for busy developers](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/workout-routine-for-busy-developers). So far I am 1 month in and it's going very well. I find it to be easier to commit to and also it's less overwhelming than going to a gym.

Also, finally, today arrived my protein powder which I have been craving to try its flavor **Optimum Nutrition Double Rich Chocolate**. To be honest, I wasn't super impressed by the taste, but maybe it was because I was using water. I will try to use milk instead and see if it's any difference.

Here is a cool link if you are not sure about which flavor to buy: https://www.wheyflavor.com/optimum-nutrition-reviews-checklist/

Also, today, I have been learning more about react-native-reanimated v2 and trying to create a custom header with slick animations. 🎆

Here is a meme to start your Monday on the right foot 😂
