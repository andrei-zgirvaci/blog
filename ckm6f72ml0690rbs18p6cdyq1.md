## How to keep track of your finances as a freelancer! üíµ

A few months ago, after my [4-year startup failed](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/4-year-startup-failed-going-freelance), I needed to find a new way to make money. Welcome to freelancing! üôå

Just kidding, it's a little bit dirtier. Perhaps this is a better visualization:

*Anyway, let's get back on track!*

For a long time, I believed that doing finances is something that is very tedious and takes a lot of time. Heck, you shouldn't even bother until you make a lot of money! *I thought to myself...*

**Well, it's not true at all!**

One person that changed my perspective was  [Ran Segall](https://www.instagram.com/ransegall/?hl=en)  in one of his amazing [videos](https://youtu.be/V2AAN7cqbO0). 

I understood that even if you are just starting out in your freelance career, it's a very good idea to keep track of your finances as this will differentiate you from an average freelancer to one that takes his business seriously and thinks long-term!

Next, I tried to search for resources on how to actually keep track of my finances. I came across Kyle Prinsloo - @studywebdevelopment who does an amazing job of educating people on how to do freelancing the right way. He also has a  [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZkRBHPGEt809C-9ju0I5hA)  which in my opinion is undervalued (make sure to check him out!).

A good starting point is to create a spreadsheet where you keep track of your income and expenses monthly. **Make sure to not overcomplicate this step as you want your spreadsheet to work for you, not the over way around!**

And this is what motivated me to create my own spreadsheet, it's basically a very close version of what Kyle demonstrated in his [video](https://youtu.be/ipzMxS5sWJ0), but simplified and adapted to my needs:

If you would like to use this spreadsheet, you can get access to it for **FREE** at [this link](https://products.andreizgirvaci.com/freelance-budget-spreadsheet).

Here are a few things you need to know in order to use this spreadsheet:
1. Watch Kyle's [video](https://youtu.be/ipzMxS5sWJ0) where he demonstrates his spreadsheet as this is a very close version of his.
2. You should change only the values in the blue fields.
3. You need to indicate an `opening balance` in one of the months in the `actual` column, once done, the future months will change accordingly.
3. The month indicator will change automatically based on the current month.

I hope you will make use of this spreadsheet as for me it's quite useful. You can also add comments in the [Google Spreadsheet](https://products.andreizgirvaci.com/freelance-budget-spreadsheet) if something is unclear, I will do my best to reply to you!

*Good luck and have fun with your finances!*

That's it for today friends! I will go ahead and enjoy my weekend. See you next week! üòä
