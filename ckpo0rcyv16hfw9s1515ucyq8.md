## I love React Native Reanimated 2! 💅

Today I worked on implementing a custom header similar to the Airbnb app.

It was a little bit hard to understand [React Native Reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) at first and learn how to use it properly, but after a while of playing around with it, I managed to implement the custom header within our app. 🎉

Here is a video that helped me to look in the right direction:

Btw, I love his videos, supper great channel, make sure to subscribe!


After I managed to pull that complex header animation, I felt great and inspired to try more complex animations and see how far I can get.

That was it for today folks! Wish you a great day ahead and see you tomorrow! 😊
