## Learning Stripe Connect 💳

Today, I had an amazing Codementor session where I helped one mentee to use Stripe API.

It turned out to be more challenging than I thought because we had to work with Stripe Connect. 😅

After an hour of intense work, we decided to continue the session tomorrow. For the rest of the day I played with Stripe Connect and finally figured out how it works, it wasn't that bad actually! 😁

Excited to get on another session and finish those tasks. 😝

Btw, If you are stuck on a problem or need some advice on something, feel free to ping me on codementor.io, I will be happy to help you! **The first 15 min is free of charge!** (for the first session on Codementor) 😊

That's it for today folks! See you tomorrow! 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
