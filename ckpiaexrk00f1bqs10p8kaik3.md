## What I learned about React Native Performance 📱

Today, I decided to start a **BlogLog**. It's basically the same thing I was doing before, but, instead of me having to come up with an original title for small articles, I will just write *BlogLog #{number}*. 😄

Today, I have been going deeper into React Native Performance and watched a great video by **William Candillon** where he discusses this topic more in-depth:

In the video, William mentioned that he built a more performant `FlatList` component and I am very curious to know if there are any good packages that replace the `FlatList` component. Please let me know in the comments if you know any!

Lately, React Native Performance has been a topic I am more curious about and want to investigate more. I would appreciate it if you can share with me any good resources about that! 😊

That's it for today folks! I wish you a great weekend ahead! Remember to spend time away from your computer and do something fun or not do anything at all, it's completely fine! 🙂

See you next Monday, take care! ❤️

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
