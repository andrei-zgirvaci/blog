## My first paid mentorship session 🦸‍♂️

Yesterday, I  got [accepted as a mentor](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/just-got-accepted-on-codementor)  at  [codementor.io](https://bit.ly/3tpIasq) and today I got my first paid mentorship session! 😊 💸

I was doing  [free mentorship](https://bit.ly/32Uw2EO)  before and already got used to coach people on their projects, but today was the first time I got paid for my contribution and it felt great! It was not a lot($13 for a 25 min session), especially after the 22% of the platform fees, but, hey, it's a start! 😁

Also, finding a request didn't turn to be that hard, hopefully, it remains the same in the future.

If you are stuck on a problem or need some advice on something, feel free to ping me on codementor.io, I will be happy to help you! **The first 15 min is free of charge!** 😊

Have a wonderful day my friends, I will see you tomorrow! 🙂

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊

*Remember, you are worthy, you are loved and you matter! Have a great day! ❤️*
