## Just got accepted on CodeMentor 🎉

Recently I have applied at codementor.io so I can make some side money while working on  [my startup](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/starting-my-new-startup-trustio) and today I was finally accepted! Yaaay 😁

If any of you need some help with React Native as this is my main area of expertise, then I would be happy to help. You can check my profile here:  [codementor.io/@andreizgirvaci](bit.ly/3tpIasq) 

Today was a shorter post and just as a disclaimer: **I am gonna write these posts almost every day so I don't expect every article to filled with super useful information and very engaging, because it's almost impossible to keep that kind of creativity. Rather, this blog will be more kind of documenting my journey as a Software Developer, Freelancer, Entrepreneur and even regular day-to-day person and struggles I encounter throughout the day and how I solve them.**

Hope you enjoy my writings and would check in again 😊 Till tomorrow, have a wonderful day my friends!

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊

*Remember, you are worthy, you are loved and you matter! Have a great day! ❤️*
