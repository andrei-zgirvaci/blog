## Finally recorded next month's podcast episode! 🙌

Yess, I finally pulled myself together and managed to record a new episode of [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz).

In it, I talk about how following your hobbies is actually beneficial for your career! The new episode should be released at the start of the next month. Say tuned! 👀

Also, recently I and my Finacee discovered a new TV Show on HBO called [Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series). I have to tell you, it's amazing! The humor and the plot are great. Can't stop watching it now... 😁

That was it for today, beautiful people, see you tomorrow! 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
