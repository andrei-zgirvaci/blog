## Almost finished making my portfolio responsive 🌟

Today I did some great progress on my [freelance portfolio](https://andreizgirvaci.com). 💪

I am almost finished making it responsive. There are just a few more things I need to figure out like where to put my profile picture when viewed on mobile. Please comment down below if you have any suggestions! 😊

Also, I want to refactor the code a little and optimize the images on my website using [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image), but so far it's giving me a hard time... 😒

That's it for today folks if you would like to see the process of developing my portfolio make sure to check my previous blog post 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊

*Remember, you are worthy, you are loved and you matter! Have a great day! ❤️*
