## This WFH Schedule makes me Productive and Keeps me Sane üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Over the years I have been trying different schedules while working remotely. I have never been employed at a company üò≥, but I had the chance to be a part of many startups, many of them as a founder.

Due to different circumstances in my life (studying, anxiety disorder, traveling) I have been trying a lot of schedules which sometimes made me supper productive, but at the same time increased my anxiety to the roof or other times when I would feel very calm, work very less, but reduced my productivity to almost 0.

# My schedule

I believe I have finally found a schedule that sits in between. It gives me the freedom to choose my work hours, let me take care of my mental health, spend time with my spouse, do personal hobbies, but also be focused and productive during my work hours.

## Morning

- 08:00 AM - Wake up, Take a Shower, Make a tea
- 09:00 AM - Meditations, Journaling, Afirmations
- 09:30 AM - Taking a breakfast
- 10:00 AM - Starting Work

One very important factor I want to talk about is that I don't touch my phone until 09:30, after I am done with my meditation. Before, I didn't realize how important this was and how big of an impact it would make on my life.

You see, waking up in the morning and turning to your phone, before even saying "Good Morning" to your spouse, it's not right. It's not only that, but your phone also bombards you with a ton of information that your mind is just not ready to process as it just woke up. So, even if you don't start working at 08:00, you give your mind a heavy load of information that it needs to process.

So, not checking my phone in the morning, turned out to be very beneficial for my mental health! I challenge you to try for 3 days and see how you feel. *Oh, I know it's hard, but the harder it is, the more you need it!*

## Afternoon

- 01:00 PM - Lunch and break 
- 02:00 PM - Back to work
- 05:00 PM - Finish work
- 05:30 PM - Walk, Yoga, Workout

Currently, I plan my day to usually work for 6 hours. I found that working more than 8 hours turns to be overkill for me and in the long term, it makes me stressed and affects my sleep in a bad way.

Where working 6 hours leaves me not too tired and allows me to spend more time on my hobbies like blogging, [podcasting](https://apple.co/39yOnvz), etc...

## Evening

- 06:00 PM - Dinner
- 07:00 PM - Blogging
- 08:30 PM - Devices off, Family time
- 10:30 PM - Go to sleep

Another very important thing I am working on now is to not use my devices after 8:30 PM. This time is reserved for me to spend with my spouse. Usually, I like to keep it that way. The hard thing for me is to keep the devices off tho, I find it challenging, but I will get there eventually...

# Conclusion

I hope that by me sharing with you my schedule, helped you to see maybe there are a few things you can integrate into your life, so your schedule can benefit you as it does for me.

And remember, your schedule should work for you. Leave room for spontaneity, you won't be able to follow your schedule 100% all the time! Your schedule should help you become a better person, not make you feel worse!
