## Improving my portfolio 💪

In some earlier posts, I shared the process of  [making my portfolio in Next.js](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/building-my-freelance-portfolio-in-nextjs)  and how I finally  [got it live](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/my-portfolio-is-live).

Today I am planning to add some additional pages to my portfolio as I find it to be quite crucial. One of which is: **a use case page for each project I worked on**.

If you have a look at my  [portfolio](https://andreizgirvaci.com/#my-work)  now, you would see that there is a link: *view project*.

If you do click that link, it will open a new tab of AppStore where the corresponding app is published. While this might work for now, eventually I want to give more context to the project, what problems I encountered along the way and how did I fix them.

I have researched a little bit and found some great portfolios that got the use case page quite right and I might inspire by them 😊:

For now, I am full-time working on my  [new startup](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/starting-my-new-startup-trustio), so I don't have much time left during the day to do other stuff, but I hope in the near future I will find some time and there where I can build the use case page.

That's it for today! See you tomorrow on another not sure what about article. 😅 Until then, take care and take it easy! 🙂

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊

*Remember, you are worthy, you are loved and you matter! Have a great day! ❤️*
