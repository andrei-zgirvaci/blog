## Getting a covid-19 vaccine in Bali 💉

I don't think I have ever talked about it, but, currently, I am living in Bali with my spouse (in Ubud to be more specific...)

Btw, Ubud is amazing and I highly recommend visiting it if you ever come to Bali! 😻

The covid situation in Bail hasn't been the best as there are a lot of foreigners who don't follow the rules (to wear a mask, respect the social distance, etc...)

Luckily, Bali started a FREE vaccine program for its citizens.

Today, they started to vaccinate people in Ubud. I with my spouse wanted to get vaccinated too, but unfortunately, I need to have a KITAS/KITAP (basically an Indonesian ID card) and my spouse needs to be a worker so she can get accepted.

We really wanted to get this vaccine, especially for my spouse as she has chronic breathing problems due to having Turbeculosis in the past. 😔 Hopefully, they will extend the vaccine to more people soon...

2020 and 2021 have been quite a challenging year for all of us and I can't wait for life to get back to normal how it was before!

Have you got the Covid-19 vaccine yet? Comment below! 👇

Stay safe and be well. See you next week! 😊
