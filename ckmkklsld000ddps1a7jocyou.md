## Hosting my first React Native Voice Chat on Telegram

Today I hosted my first React Native Voice Chat on Telegram 😊

Now that Telegram introduced Voice Chats for channels (basically clubhouse, but better) ...

... I decided it would benefit my [React Native Status](https://bit.ly/2IJzHP3) Telegram channel a lot as I could interact with my audience easier and share knowledge with each other.

Today's topic was **"The Good and Bad of React Native 🌶️"** and it was a lot of fun to find out what different people find frustrating and like about React Native.

### The Good

Some good points that were mentioned about React Native were:

1. It's really great to see that most of the code works on both Android and iOS without having to do major changes to support both platforms.
2. Expo it's really easy to use and saves a lot of frustrations when updating and installing React Native packages.
3. After version 0.60, React Native with its Auto Linking feature, making it a lot easier to add Native libraries into your projects. Thankfully now, we don't have to spend 2 hours fixing our Xcode build due to library incompatibility issues.

### The Bad

Some bad points that were mentioned about React Native were:

1. It's still sometimes hard to update React Native to a new version as you have to go and update native Android and iOS files which could be easily messed up.
2. Creating responsive designs (like fonts) it's still hard, but luckily some packages like  [drispy](https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy) make it a little bit easier.
3. Sometimes the app size can be quite large depending on packages. A good tool that helps identify heavy packages is [react-native-bundle-visualizer](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-native-bundle-visualizer). Also,  [generating AAB](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android#generating-the-release-aab)  files instead of APK also reduces the file size a lot!
