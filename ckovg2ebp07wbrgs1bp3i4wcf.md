## Long time, no see 🙋‍♂️

A few weeks ago, I and my wife [got covid-19](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/covid-19-hit-us-taking-a-break). After which I decided to take a break from blogging until we recover. Luckily, everything went fine, we managed to recover and carry on with our life. 😌

And just after recovering, I got accepted to a mediation retreat which I have been waiting for for about 1 year. 🧘‍♂️ Meditation plays a big role in my life as it helps me [contrate better](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/how-meditation-improved-my-productivity-as-a-developer) on the task at hand (work) and also helps me become more mindful in my daily life.

The silent retreat is called [Vipassana](http://dhamma.org/) and I would probably write a separate article about my experience there. But until then, you can watch my live where I touched on that topic!

**tl;dr:** the experience was very challenging but I gained a lot of insight and learned a lot about myself!

Now that I have come back, I want to get back on blogging again every day of the week. ✍️

Also, I have missed recording this month's podcast episode for [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) show. I should get on that this weekend... 🥱

Until then, see you tomorrow. I missed you guys 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
