## Feeling like not doing anything... 🐈

To be honest, for the last couple of days, I haven't been feeling very energetic. Not sure what's the reason behind it. Maybe it's the rain (like my grandma says 😂) or some other mystical thing happening with me or the world... 👽

I guess it's more of an anxious + depressed state I have been feeling this week as I have a lot of stuff to do like preparing documents to get married before [leaving bali](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/preparing-to-leave-bali), [having a lot of expenses and little income](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/how-i-made-dollar479-as-a-mentor), buying gifts for my family and friends, finishing an MVP app for [my startup](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/starting-my-new-startup-trustio) by 15th of April, recording a [podcast episode](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) and publishing this [blogs almost every day](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/blogging-almost-every-day-in-2021)...

Wow, that a lot of stuff I didn't even think was stuck in my head... 😅 You know, sometimes it's good to write down everything you feel so you can understand the root cause better.

Anyway, this is one of those posts where I share my daily life and not actually trying to teach you something. Leave a like if you enjoy these too! 👍

💬 Let me know in the comments below if you also have been feeling like not doing anything for the last couple of days! 😅

That's it for today folks! See you tomorrow! Love you all! ❤️

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
