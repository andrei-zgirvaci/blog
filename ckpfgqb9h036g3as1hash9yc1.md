## React Native Performance - Must Read Articles 📚

Today, I have decided to learn more about React Native Performance and how to optimize my RN App accordingly.

# To Read

I would like to share with you some useful articles that I came upon today:

%[https://blog.discord.com/how-discord-achieves-native-ios-performance-with-react-native-390c84dcd502]

These two articles were highly insightful about some common mistakes we as developers make and the pitfalls we run into so I highly recommend giving them a read! 📖

Next, I would give a read to these articles:

That's all for today, I feel quite tired and don't have much else to share with you today. I will catch up tomorrow with all you beautiful people! Have an amazing rest of the day! 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
