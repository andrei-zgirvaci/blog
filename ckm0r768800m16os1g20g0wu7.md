## Starting my new startup TRUSTIO üöÄ

Hi everyone, today I am starting a new startup trustio.co üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

After my previous [4-year startup failed](https://blog.andreizgirvaci.com/4-year-startup-failed-going-freelance), I and my team decided to start a new project.

Sorry for not providing any context about the app concept and design, but that is still in the early-stage. However, I might share it later in the development process based on the NDA...

So far we have done more than 25 interviews and most of them have been positive. We are actually thinking to make this project more generally, but for now, we are just gonna focus on our niche.

For the technical stack, I am gonna use React Native along with AWS Amplify. Luckily, now, I am not gonna be the only developer as my partner will take on the back-end side and I am gonna focus mostly on the front-end side.

Today, I spent some time planning the folder structure of my project as this was a huge benefit for my previous project. I believe that planning ahead saves you a lot of time and frustration in the future as it's quite hard to change stuff once you already have a full-scale app.

For the project structure, I use a mix of ducks and domain-driven design folder structure. I will write a blog post on that later, but for now, you can read this article which I was inspired by https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-folder-structure.

Here is a sneak peek into the folder structure I am planning to use:

Tomorrow I have a meeting with my team to discuss the database design and make sure we all are on board with the development process before we start making the app. I am planning to release an MVP in one month to both iOS and Android users so we can test our market early.

That's it for today! See you tomorrow if you want to join me on my crazy journey üòä

BTW, today, I have just published a new episode of [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it.
