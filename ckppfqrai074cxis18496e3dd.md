## React Native Reanimated is being a turd on Android! 🤖

Today, I have been messing around with **React Native Reanimated 2** again and found a bug that's really frustrating.

While the header animation was working perfectly fine on iOS, on Android, it was very lagging and creating weird flickering problems.

At first, I didn't realize what could be the issue, but after going through some GitHub issues I found that it was related to animating the View `height`.

This is not the first time I encounter problems like this where it works perfectly fine on iOS while Android is being a turd... 😾

I hope in the feature less and less bugs will happen between 2 different platforms as it could take a lot of time trying to figure out what is the issue and how to fix it.

But, that was it for today folks. I will see you tomorrow! 😊
