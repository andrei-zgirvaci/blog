## 🔴 Live event with you!

Hey friends, long time no see! 👋

I decided to host a live event this **Saturday (28) - 7:30 Singaporean Time** where I am gonna interview developers around the world 🌎 just like you about their experience while working as a Software Developer. 👨‍💻

I am curious to know what challenges you face daily and how you manage your stress at work. Also I am gonna share some of my tips on the same topic. 👍

I hope to see you there! 😊

p.s 🤫 I recently started a podcast called [The Anxious Developer](https://apple.co/39yOnvz) where I share my knowledge on how to reduce your stress, become more present and productive as a Developer. I would love to hear your thoughts on it! 😊
