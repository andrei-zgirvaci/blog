## Did 100 squats today, can't feel my legs... 😩

Today I tried a new workout routine. Instead of doing a 30 min workout like usual, I tried a 15 min one but focused just on one exercise (full squats).

My exercise consisted of 2 sets of 50. I thought it won't be that bad, but, man... it was hard!

I was even thinking that after my workout, I am gonna go for a short walk... Well, my legs didn't agree with me on that! 😂

I am planning to write a more in-depth article next Monday on how to create your own workout routine that won't feel overwhelming and you can actually stick with it. I know we Software Developers don't like to move too much, so this will be a nice way to get started in fitness.

I have had many times in the past when my workout routine was too hard and I lacked the motivation and discipline to follow it up. I think now, I finally found a way to keep myself in shape and at the same time be consistent and not too hard to prevent giving up early. 💪

That's it for today folks! Like I said, I am planning to write a more in-depth article about my workout on Monday which I believe can be very beneficial to you too. So stick around! 😝
